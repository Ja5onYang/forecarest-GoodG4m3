This lottery system uses Python's Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI). Tkinter is a standard GUI library for Python that provides an object-oriented approach to creating and managing user interfaces.
The following are the main technical features and advantages of this lottery system:

1. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Design: Using the Tkinter library, we can easily create GUI components such as windows, buttons, labels, and text boxes. In this lottery system, we have created a window containing a text box for user input, a label displaying user points, 12 labels displaying prizes, and a button for the lottery.

2. Event driven programming: In GUI applications, user actions (such as clicking a button, entering text, etc.) trigger events, and we need to write event handlers to respond to these events. In this lottery system, we have written event handling functions for the enter key event of the text box and the click event of the lottery button.

3. Random lottery algorithm: We use Python's random library to implement random lottery. When the user clicks on the lottery button, we randomly select a prize from the prize list.
4. Integral system: Every time a user inputs content, their points will increase by a little. When the points reach 10, the user can participate in a lottery. This integration system can motivate users to participate more and use this application.

5. Ease of use and scalability: The design of this lottery system is simple and intuitive, and users can easily understand and use it. Meanwhile, due to our use of object-oriented programming, this system is also easy to expand. For example, we can add more prizes or change the rules and algorithms of the lottery.

Overall, this lottery system utilizes Python's Tkinter and Random libraries, event driven programming, and random lottery algorithms to implement a simple but fully functional lottery application.
