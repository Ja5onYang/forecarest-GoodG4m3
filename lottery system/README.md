This lottery system uses Python's Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI). Tkinter is a standard GUI library for Python that provides an object-oriented approach to creating and managing user interfaces.
The following are the main technical features and advantages of this lottery system:

1. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Design: Using the Tkinter library, we can easily create GUI components such as windows, buttons, labels, and text boxes. In this lottery system, we have created a window containing a text box for user input, a label displaying user points, 12 labels displaying prizes, and a button for the lottery.

2. Event driven programming: In GUI applications, user actions (such as clicking a button, entering text, etc.) trigger events, and we need to write event handlers to respond to these events. In this lottery system, we have written event handling functions for the enter key event of the text box and the click event of the lottery button.

3. Random lottery algorithm: We use Python's random library to implement random lottery. When the user clicks on the lottery button, we randomly select a prize from the prize list.
4. Integral system: Every time a user inputs content, their points will increase by a little. When the points reach 10, the user can participate in a lottery. This integration system can motivate users to participate more and use this application.

5. Ease of use and scalability: The design of this lottery system is simple and intuitive, and users can easily understand and use it. Meanwhile, due to our use of object-oriented programming, this system is also easy to expand. For example, we can add more prizes or change the rules and algorithms of the lottery.

Overall, this lottery system utilizes Python's Tkinter and Random libraries, event driven programming, and random lottery algorithms to implement a simple but fully functional lottery application

* Restrictions: The current lottery system only supports 12 prizes, and the probability of each prize being drawn is the same. If you need to support more prizes or different extraction probabilities, you may need to modify the lottery algorithm.

Improvement: The current points system is relatively simple, with users adding one point for each input. You can consider introducing more complex integration rules, such as increasing points based on the length or quality of user input content.

* Restrictions: The current user interface (UI) design is relatively simple and does not use images or animations to enhance the user experience. If you need a richer UI, you may need to use more advanced GUI libraries, such as PyQt or Kivy.

Improvement: The current lottery results simply change the corresponding prize label to red, and the user experience may not be good enough. You can consider adding some animation effects, such as quickly flashing all prize labels during the draw and slowly stopping on the winning prize.

* Restrictions: The current program can only run locally. If multiple users need to use it on different devices, it may need to be transformed into a network application, such as using the Flask or Django framework.

Improvement: The current program does not save users' points and lottery history. If you need these features, you can consider adding database support, such as using SQLite or MySQL.
