To implement the uniqueness of the items, here is a step-by-step breakdown:
  
1. generate the unique id and color feature
  We use timestamp + 1~100000 random number to generate a unique item id
```python
def generate_id():
  timestamp = int(time.time() * 1000) 
  random_num = random.randint(1, 100000) 
  unique_id = str(timestamp) + str(random_num) 
  return unique_id
```  
  In order to make it discrete enough, the color feature is more random and as unique as possible, the id is hashed.
  Based on these, we initialize a simple tree picture,  just for demo. In the complete product, this part will be omitted, and the items of the same template will be processed by random color through the edge detection technique described later.
  the generation of the name of each item, we also initialize a simple adjective and name database, when the item is drawn, the name will be simultaneously and randomly generated.
  for the demo, we generated two items. Although there is only one type of item, it is mainly to illustrate the random generation of colors and nicknames.

  Also, the corresponding information will be stored in order to call it anytime.

2. edge detection/segmentation
   we use python to make it possible to identify the contour of the item. Theoretically, by segmenting the shape, we can do the processing mentioned above.
   Here is an example:

3. generate a litter story
   The ability of python can still make it. we import openai to generate an interesting story. Through some training samples, AI can automatically writes a short profile. This part should work.
