To implement the cyberbully judgement functionality, here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. When a user enters text, we need to determine whether its utterance is related to cyber violence or not.
A database containing normal and insulting language is generated and used to train the model. When our product is made mature, it will store the user input data into the database to improve the training accuracy.

2. The python file determines if the statement is cyber violence related by calculating the value of the 0-1 interval.
